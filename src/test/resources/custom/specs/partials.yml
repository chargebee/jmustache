overview: |
  Partial tags are used to expand an external template into the current
  template.

  The tag's content MUST be a non-whitespace character sequence NOT containing
  the current closing delimiter.

  This tag's content names the partial to inject.  Set Delimiter tags MUST NOT
  affect the parsing of a partial.  The partial MUST be rendered against the
  context stack local to the tag.  If the named partial cannot be found, the
  empty string SHOULD be used instead, as in interpolations.

  Partial tags SHOULD be treated as standalone when appropriate.  If this tag
  is used standalone, any whitespace preceding the tag should treated as
  indentation, and prepended to each line of the partial before rendering.
tests:

  - name: Nested Partial Indent
    desc: "Nested partials should including the parent partials indent"
    data: { content: "<\n->" }
    template: "|\n {{>partial}}\n|\n"
    partials:
      partial: "1\n {{>nest}}\n1\n"
      nest: "2\n{{{content}}}\n2\n"
    expected: "|\n 1\n  2\n  <\n->\n  2\n 1\n|\n"

  - name: Standalone Indentation
    desc: Each line of the partial should be indented before rendering.
    data: { content: "<\n->" }
    template: |
      \
       {{>partial}}
      /
    partials:
      partial: |
        |
        {{{content}}}
        |
    expected: |
      \
       |
       <
      ->
       |
      /
